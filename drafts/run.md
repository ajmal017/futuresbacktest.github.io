# Run

This page allows importing transaction history, computing current positions and target positions for a specific portfolio and replaying your historical P&L, with detailed performance analysis and performance attribution.

## Transactions

This tabs allows inputing transactions history. If you whish, we can retrieve your transactions data directly from InteractiveBrokers (IB), using their FlexQuery API. IB's Flex Queries provide a highly configurable read-only access to your IB account data. Credentials used to run Flex Queries (access token and query ID) do not grant us any other access right on your account.

## Positions

On this tab, we compute your current positions based on your transaction history and the last target positions of any of your backtested portfolios. You can then compare your current positions to your target portfolio positions. This feature is provided as a convenience tool only and should not be in any case relied upon when taking investment decisions. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or the completness of the data presented here.

## P&L

Replay your historical P&L using our data and your transaction history on this tab. Your historical P&L comes with detailed analysis and performance attribution to each ticker and asset class of your futures contracts portfolio.
