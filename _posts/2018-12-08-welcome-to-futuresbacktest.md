Welcome to our website! We hope that you'll like it. In short, FuturesBacktest is a platform where you can backtest portfolios of futures contracts, learn and test your ideas.

<!--more-->

While other platforms provide a raw backtesting engine and require you to write computer code, we chose a simpler approach where you can test a variety of strategies and fine tune your backtest directly in your browser, through a simple user interface.

You may find our platform somehow opinionated, even if we constantly try to add more simulation options. We focus on the so called [trend, carry and value factors](/docs/strategies/) (that we prefer to call strategies), applied to [all futures contracts](/docs/contracts/) across assets classes. We believe that these factors can bring value and interesting diversification potential to every investor.

Our goal is to provide you with an easy way to experiment with these strategies that you could eventually turn into actionable trading strategy. [Sign up now](/signup) for a free account! The website is still at a beta stage, which means that not all intended features are yet available and you might still encounter some bugs. Please do not hesitate to [contact](/contact) us if you'd like to learn more.

Happy backtesting!
