# Terms of Service

The use of this website is subject to the following terms of service.

We provide our service on a best effort basis and we cannot guarantee the content and the data provided to be accurate. We provide only software and not investment advice: by no mean the information and calculations provided on FuturesBacktest may be considered as personalized investment advice, or as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security or position on a futures contract. As a consequence, you are solely responsible and accountable for your investment decisions, and we cannot under any circumstances be held responsible for a financial loss that you could incur due to your investment decisions.

Investment strategies presented on this website are not appropriate for all investors. All investors should evaluate carefully and by their own assessment the risks involved in these strategies before taking any investment decision in these strategies. Futures contracts can bring a high level of leverage which can result in financial losses larger than invested capital.

Simulated performance carried on past data cannot reflect future returns: a strategy which performed well in the past can stop working in the future.

By using this website you agree to be bound by these terms of service. If you disagree with any provision of these terms of service, you must discontinue using this website.
