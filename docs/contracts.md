# The contracts
  
We provide daily price data and indicators for a selection of futures contracts traded at the main exchanges ([CME](http://www.cmegroup.com/), [EUREX](http://www.eurexchange.com/exchange-en/), [ICE](https://www.theice.com/index), [ASX](https://www.asx.com.au/), [SGX](http://sgx.com), [Montr√©al Exchange](https://www.m-x.ca/)).
  
Prices are made available publically on [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/). We carrefuly correct the data from various anomalies (gaps, change of multiples, etc.).
  
On this page we describe the futures contracts you can find on FuturesBacktest.
